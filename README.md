test slide show

Here are two website: www.bumble.com and www.mambajs.com/

As you can see the two websites are pretty identical except the image slider section on the bottom of the home page is different due to the different js plug-in are deployed. 

Please make the scrolling animation of the image slider on mambas.com exactly the same as the one on bumble.com. Send me a live url for us to check once you finish the task.

Let me know if you have any questions to this task.

You will need to make the change based on the codes of mambajs.com
